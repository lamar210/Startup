HTML startup code notes:

- hrefs for clicks with links to different pages

- Buttons are for implmentations on the same page (you can add the one click feature so it shows the user and console there's something to be clicked)

- (br) is to break up the lines

- Some styling can be done through HTML

- Spans are used for sliders

- For each page you need a different file

- When making labels, for checkboxes for example, make sure to include the type, name and value with label commands

- ^ For buttons: Type, aria-label, and title
